# zmk-config

My personal [ZMK firmware][3] configuration for my 34-key [Hypergolic][1] wireless keyboard.

## Keymap

See [`config/cradio.keymap`](config/cradio.keymap) for a visualisation of the current keymap layout.

* [Colemak Mod-DH][8] layout on the base layer
* Simple thumb-activated layers for a numpad and a navigation cluster; each with sticky modifiers on the home row
* Symbols on base layer via one-handed combos (in [`combos.dtsi`](config/combos.dtsi))
* Macro-combos for symbol n-grams such as `()`, `--` and `` ``` `` (in [`macros.dtsi`](config/macros.dtsi))

The keymap is continuously evolving and I'm still slowly porting across some features from [my QMK keymap][7] (like the [steno-lite][11] functionality). I have recently moved away from dual function keys (such as [home row mods][9]) instead trying sticky keys, in an attempt to reduce the amount of keys that need to be held.

I currently use the [`Makefile`](Makefile) to install a local ZMK environment via the [ZMK Docker images][10], apply my required patches/PRs, and then build and flash my `uf2` binaries to the nice!nano microcontrollers â€“ all by running a single `make` command!
