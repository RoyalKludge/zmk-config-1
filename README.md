## Keyboard

* [Hypergolic][1] split keyboard PCB by @davidphilipbarr
* [nice!nano][2] wireless BLE controllers
* [ZMK keyboard firmware][3]
* [Kailh Choc low profile key switches][6]
  * gChoc on pinky columns (20g, linear)
  * Red Pro everywhere else (35g, linear)
* [Chicago Stenographer keycaps][4] by @pseudoku on the thumb keys
* [MBK choc keycaps][5] everywhere else

## Keymap

The actual keymap is still very much a work in progress as I slowly port it from
[my QMK keymap][7].
